# 🚦 HITL – Human-in-the-Loop AI Middleware

**When your AI agents get stuck, HITL will escalate to you (or your team) in real time via Slack, SMS, or Voice—so workflows never fail silently.**

> 🛠️ **⚠️ PRE-LAUNCH EARLY ACCESS**
> HITL is still in **active development**.
>
> * We’re gathering **early supporters** & feedback
> * Pre-ordering Pilot helps fund development & gives you **priority access** when we launch

## 🧐 Why HITL?

AI agents are powerful but brittle. When they hit low confidence or a decision point, they:

❌ Hallucinate
❌ Break workflows
❌ Lose user trust

✅ **HITL fixes this.**
When your AI is stuck, it will **pause**, **escalate to you or your team in real time**, get your input, and **resume seamlessly**.

---

## 🚀 How It Will Work

1️⃣ **AI detects low confidence or a decision point**
2️⃣ **AI escalates to you (or your team)** via Slack, SMS, or Voice call
3️⃣ **You respond → AI resumes workflow**

## 🛠️ Current Status

HITL is **NOT LIVE YET**.

We’re building the core:

| Stripe payment & upgrades        | 🛠️ Planned        |
